Lately, other than Docker and Compose, I started using Kubernetes as deployment method since some of our customers requested to use a cluster to deploy the applications. I am able to use Kubernetes to deploy and monitor the pods, and to manage the cluster.
As of now, I have used clusters hosted by AWS and Azure.
