Ruby is a language that I started learning for fun. I was searching for a programming language that allowed me to express myself and that I could use also on my toy projects without worrying too much about the configuration and the types.
First I encountered Ruby On Rails and I was amazed by it, and I realized that I had so much fun using it that I started thinking about using it also professionally.
Right now I am developing a little application using RoR and Ruby. Maybe someday it will become something that I can proud of.
