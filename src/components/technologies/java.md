The Java Programming Language is the main language that I daily use. My experience start with Java 8, but for working reasons I also used version 7. I use Java mainly for REST API development, database access using Hibernate and system integration using the Apache Camel library. When I started working, I also learned the J2EE platform, mainly for the web. As container for the web development, I used WILDFLY and JBoss.
