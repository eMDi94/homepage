I started using Spring Boot when I decided to simplify the architecture of the system I was working. I realized that, first I needed to gain some experience with the framework. Luckily, my job requires to develop a lot of integrations with third part softwares, so I developed them with Spring Boot. I really fell in love with it: its simplicity, its expressivness and the presence of a great number of plugins makes it one of the best framework I have ever used.
Now I am rewriting the system I am working on with it.
