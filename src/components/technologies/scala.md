Scala was the first functional programming language I used. Since my years in university, I started to get into functional programming, but I didn't have the opportunity to study it.
When I started working, my mentor introduced me to the FP in Scala. It wasn't love at first sight, but then I realized how powerful it is. Obviously, I had to change my approach to programming, shifting from OOP to FP. It was a long process, but it was worth the effort.
