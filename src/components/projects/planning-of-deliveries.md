This is a system that I developed to satisfy the request of a customer that needed to plan the deliveries of the surgical instruments to the hospitals. It keeps track of the delivery rounds and allows to plan the deliveries based on the availability of drivers and equipment to deliver the items.
The system tries to find a match between all the variables to produce an optimal plan.
Technologies used: Java (8 and above), Quarkus, Angular, LitElement.
