This software is similar to the Track&Trace software, but it is used to track technical tissue instead of surgical instruments.
The goal of the system is the same: store the data of the sterilization process of the items.
The volume of data is greater than the Track&Trace and it requires a lot more integrations, particularly for reading the chips inside the items.
For this software, I followed its lifecyle from the very beggining.
Technologies used: Java (8 and above), Wildfly, J2EE, Quarkus, Spring Boot, Scala, Play Framework, LitElement, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes.
