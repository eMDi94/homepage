This is the main project I worked on since starting working.
The goal of the software is to track the sterilization reprocessing of surgical instruments and store those information in a way that enables a fast retrieve of the information when needed. 
In Italy, it is mandatory to store and preserve those data for 10 years. 
I also developed a number of integration with third part softwares to exchange data.
Technologies used: Java (8 and above), Wildfly, J2EE, Quarkus, Spring Boot, Scala, Play Framework, Kafka, LitElement, Docker, Kubernetes.
